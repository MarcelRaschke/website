We've been working hard to improve Dependabot's Gradle support, and are
upgrading its status to "beta".

We [launched Gradle support][gradle-support] back in May with a very basic
`build.gradle` parser. Since then we've made a lot of improvements:
- Over 1,000 gradle update PRs generated by Dependabot have been merged
- Our `build.gradle` parsing logic has been completely rewritten
- Support for updating versions specified with aproperty has been added
- Dependabot now parses the repositories you're using from your buildfile and
  checks for available versions at only those locations

We'll keep working to improve our Gradle support, and would love your
[feedback][feedback-link] if you're using it, but it's no longer an "early
alpha" product. We think Dependabot's Gradle support should now be good enough
for you to rely on.
